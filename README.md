KnockoutJS is a very useful two way data binding library. There are some great articles on it in code project and the Knockout website itself has some very good tutorials and examples. If you are working with lists and arrays you may find my article on searching filtering and sorting knockout lists useful. This article assumes you are familiar with Knockout and need some insight into using arrays with Knockout and passing that array data back to an MVC application.

The article provides simple walk-through instruction on working with arrays in KnockoutJS, and demonstrates how to save KnockoutJS JSON data from the client browser to server using a mapped ViewModel object.
